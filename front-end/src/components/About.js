      <h1>Who We Are</h1>

      <br />
      <p>
        To begin with, suicidal thoughts are these gentle whispers that clog
        your mind leaving you almost helpless. Hey! not to worry, we have
        highlighted critical steps you can take to deal with these thoughts.
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
        WISQARS, suicide is the second leading cause of death among individuals
        between the ages of 10–14 and 25–34. Shocking right? It even ranks
        higher than accidents.

      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
      Improve the community’s understanding of mental health and the mind-body connection between mental and physical health.
Provide education and opportunities for individuals to identify early warning signs of mental illness and subsequently provide programs and an environment that supports recovery and improves resilience for these individuals.
Assure that those who request information and need mental health care referral have confidential access to the appropriate information and know how to obtain care.
Advocate for improved support and treatment particularly at the state and federal levels, especially where reform is needed.

      <h1>Our Mission </h1>
      <p>
      Every person, regardless of their disability, race, ethnicity, gender, age, economic status, or sexual orientation, has the right and responsibilities to full potential in our society, the right to be treated with compassion, respect and dignity, free from stigma and prejudice.
Mental health is essential to personal well being, and is fundamental to achieving a healthy, balanced, and productive life.
Treatment offers a powerful return on investment and treatment does work if used appropriately. With treatment options, what was only a hope in the past is quickly becoming a reality. We will persistently advocate for treatment and services for those who need them.
Unless we promote community understanding of mental illness, plus tolerance and acceptance of people living with the illness, people will continue to avoid talking about mental illness and also avoid seeking help.
The goal of treatment is recovery, and it is important for those with a mental illness to be an integral part of their recovery process – decisions, programs, support groups, medication regimens.
We fulfill our mission most effectively when we collaborate with others and when we actively look for partners to achieve our goals.
We recognize achievement of our vision depends on the combined dedication, creativity and compassion of our staff, Board of Directors, volunteers, partners, and those we serve.
